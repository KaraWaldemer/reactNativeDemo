## <a id="getting-started"></a>Getting Started

React Native requires that you have Node and NPM installed and configured. This guide will assume that you have already completed that step and have a basic understanding of both Node and React. If you need a refresher, please check out the documentation for [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/).

#### <a id="react-native-cli"></a>React Native CLI

React Native is a node module that can be installed with NPM like any other. If you choose to go that route, you will have to configure everything for your project yourself which will require a thorough understanding of Node, iOS, and Android project configuration. If you already have this knowledge, you will be able to set up the project exactly how you see fit. However, if you would rather let a tool handle that initial setup for you, then there is the React Native CLI.
